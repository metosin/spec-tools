  `spell-spec.alpha/keys` is a spec macro that has the same signature and
  behavior as clojure.spec.alpha/keys. In addition to performing the
  same checks that `clojure.spec.alpha/keys` does, it checks to see if
  there are unknown keys present which are also close misspellings of

  An important aspect of this behavior is that the map is left open to
  other keys that are not close misspellings of the specified
  keys. Keeping maps open is an important pattern in Clojure which
  allows one to simply add behavior to a program by adding extra data
  to maps that flow through functions. spell-spec.alpha/keys keeps
  this in mind and is fairly conservative in its spelling checks."
